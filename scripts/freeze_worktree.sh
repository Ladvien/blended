# One frozen checkout per COMMIT, in one place, cleaned up when idle.
#
# Why this exists. A benchmark roll takes ~3 h and starts a fresh Blender
# per instance that imports the source tree AT THAT MOMENT, so editing
# src/ mid-roll changes what later instances run. The fix is to run each
# roll from a frozen git worktree. The fix's own failure mode is sprawl:
# on 2026-09-10 six worktrees accumulated in one evening — blended-bench,
# -v2, -v4, -old, -incumbent, -iter — 839 MB, of which ~700 MB was dead,
# because each was made ad hoc, named after its purpose rather than its
# commit, scattered across $HOME, and never removed.
#
# Three rules, each aimed at one of those causes:
#   * ONE PARENT.   Everything lives under $FREEZE_ROOT.
#   * NAMED BY COMMIT.  Two freezes of the same commit are the same
#     directory, so asking twice costs nothing and cannot fork.
#   * PRUNED.  `--prune` removes every freeze no live process is inside.

#   scripts/freeze_worktree.sh --prune       # remove the idle ones
#
# The path is the only thing printed on stdout, so a caller can do:
#   WORKTREE=$(scripts/freeze_worktree.sh HEAD) scripts/bench_chain.sh

# A freeze is "in use" when any process has a file open under it, or its
# cwd there. Checked with lsof rather than pgrep: a Blender started from
# the freeze may not carry the path in its command line, and deleting a
# tree out from under a running roll would void the roll silently.
#
# Test the OUTPUT, never the exit status: lsof exits non-zero whenever it
# hits any unreadable path, even while printing real results. Measured
# 2026-09-10 — the first draft read `lsof ... > /dev/null 2>&1` as the
# condition, so a tree with 12 open files under it reported idle and was
# deleted. A probe has to be shown to fire before it is trusted.
