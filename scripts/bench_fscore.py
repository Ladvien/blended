"""F-score beside Chamfer, and an audit of the references themselves.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Chamfer distance is a poor discriminator of shape.
Tatarchenko, Richter, Ranftl, Li, Koltun & Brox, "What Do Single-View 3D
Reconstruction Networks Learn?", CVPR 2019 (DOI 10.1109/cvpr.2019.00352)
showed that under CD and IoU, pure retrieval and classification baselines
are statistically indistinguishable from methods that claim to
reconstruct: the metrics are dominated by category-level priors, so a
mean shape of the right category scores well. Their recommendation is
F-score at a distance threshold, which separates *surface agreement* from
*being the average object*.

This repo's own numbers fit that thesis and are why the tool was written
(measured 2026-09-10 on the OT-27 holdout rolls):

  * forcing the reference's exact aspect ratios onto our meshes — an
    oracle no writer could beat — moves mean cd_pca only 0.0270 -> 0.0227,
    so proportion is nearly worthless as a lever;
  * the orientation term is at the holdout's documented floor of 0.0590
    (see docs/2026-09-04-chat-harness-plan.md P8a), which is a property of
    the references, not of our placement;
  * Nautilus_seed0 scores WORST of twenty while rendering as a proper
    spiral shell, against a reference that renders as a thin needle.

So before any more model time is spent on the remaining form residual,
the instrument is checked. Two outputs:

1. F-score, precision and recall per instance at several thresholds.
   Precision is "of the surface we made, how much belongs"; recall is "of
   the surface that should be there, how much did we make". CD folds
   those into one number, which is exactly why it cannot say whether a
   model invented surface or missed it.

2. A reference audit. A reference that is degenerate makes its instance
   unscoreable, and that must be reported rather than silently averaged
   into a mean that then ranks configurations.

The scorer's own sampling, normalisation and KD-trees are imported from
<bench>/metrics/shape_chamfer.py rather than reimplemented, exactly as
scripts/diagnose_3dcode.py does, so these numbers sit in the same space
as the ones the panel already reports.

Runs under the bench venv (trimesh + numpy + scipy; no Blender):
