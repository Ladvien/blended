"""Is a 3DCodeBench candidate a REGRESSION against the roll that set the
guard — and could this benchmark even see the improvement being asked for?

`compare_3dcode_rolls.py` answers "how far apart do two rolls of the SAME
configuration land". This answers the two questions that decide a
contract:

1. **Regression test.** Pair every instance between one baseline roll and
   the candidate's rolls, then read the mean paired difference against its
   own standard error. The guard is the BASELINE'S OWN measured mean on
   the ranking metric, computed at run time — there is no literal guard
   in this file, because a guard quoted from one roll of an axis whose
   between-roll SD is 0.0072 is the minimum of the draws taken, not an
   expected value. On this benchmark the per-instance paired SD is ~0.10,
   so a 20-instance mean carries ~0.023 of standard error and any smaller
   "movement" is a coin flip being reported as a result.
2. **Resolvable effect.** Given that measured SD, how many instance-rolls
   would it take to resolve `TARGET_RELATIVE_IMPROVEMENT` of the guard at
   2 and 3 sigma? If the answer is "more rolls than anyone will run", the
   target is a property of the instrument, not of the harness.

The ranking metric, the minimum roll count and the relative target all
come from `bench_thresholds`, which `bench_panel.py` reads too: two files
disagreeing about what "better" means is how a coin flip gets promoted.
Consumes `diagnose_3dcode.py --json` files only — it recomputes nothing a
scorer has not already produced — and shares that loader plus the
instance-set intersection with `compare_3dcode_rolls.py`, so a set
disagreement is one hard failure in one place.

Pure stdlib, so it runs under a bare `python3`:

    python3 scripts/paired_bench_delta.py --label holdout_no_regression \
      --baseline outputs/bench/diagnose_blended-deepseek-v4-pro.json \
