"""The 3DCodeBench verdict as a PANEL, under a pre-registered rule.

Neither existing generator answers this. `compare_3dcode_rolls.py` answers
"what is the noise band per metric" for one configuration;
`paired_bench_delta.py` answers "is this candidate a regression against a
named baseline". Neither puts the axes side by side with an executability
gate and a written ranking rule, which is what a decision needs.

The rule is pre-registered in `bench_thresholds`, not chosen here, and it
is chosen BEFORE the next experiment on purpose. Measured over the six
surviving 20-instance rolls:

    axis          mean     between-roll SD   SE of a 20-mean
    cd_yawmin     0.0769   0.0072            0.0090
    cd_pca        0.0252   0.0022            0.0018
    delta_orient  0.0517   0.0061            0.0082

`delta_orient = cd_yawmin - cd_pca` by construction
(`scripts/diagnose_3dcode.py`), and it carries 89% of cd_yawmin's
between-roll variance while being 33% of its mean. So ranking on
cd_yawmin ranks a per-instance orientation coin flip: a 15% shape gain is
2.1 sigma on cd_pca and 0.4 sigma on cd_yawmin. cd_yawmin stays on every
panel — it is the scorer's own number — but it does not rank.

Pure stdlib, so it runs under a bare `python3`:
