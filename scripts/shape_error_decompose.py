"""Decompose a blended model row's 3DCodeBench chamfer into its components.

Answers one question before any live model time is spent: how much of a
model row's `cd_yawmin` is orientation, how much is proportion (aspect
ratio), and how much is form that neither of those can reach.

    cd_yawmin  = cd_pca + Δ_orient                     (orientation split)
    cd_pca     = proportion_headroom + form_residual   (shape split)

`cd_pca` is the chamfer after the generated cloud is rotated by the best of
the 24 proper rotations mapping its PCA frame onto the reference's, so
orientation is quotiented out. `form_residual` is `cd_pca` measured again
after the generated cloud's extent *ratios* have been forced onto the
reference's own — an oracle no writer could beat — and the difference
between the two is the proportion headroom.

Two details decide every number this script prints; both were established
by measurement (2026-09-03) and are pinned here so the arithmetic cannot
drift:

1. **The target ratios come from the reference cloud's WORLD-axis extents**
   (its glTF bounding box: `sorted(ptp)` descending, as `mid/max, min/max`),
   not from its PCA-basis extents. World-axis ratios are the quantity a
   writer could actually author, and they are what the recorded holdout
   aspect means (reference mid/max 0.578, generated 0.560, mean paired error
   0.195) were measured in. Using PCA-basis targets instead flattens a coil
   into the reference's inertia-frame slab and collapses the oracle to a
   degenerate 0.0098 mean on this holdout — the report prints that variant's
   mean too, labelled, so the two can never be confused again.
2. **After rescaling the axes, both clouds MUST go back through the scorer's
   `normalize_unit_sphere`.** Rescaling per-axis without re-normalising
   leaves the generated cloud shrunk inside the unit sphere and absorbs part
   of the alignment into the scale, which understates the residual.

Replication, not reimplementation: the metric comes from the benchmark's
own `metrics/shape_chamfer.py`, and the rotation helpers from
`scripts/diagnose_3dcode.py`. Sampling follows the scorer exactly — one
`default_rng(0)` shared across instances, reference cloud sampled before
the generated one, 8192 points, both clouds unit-sphere normalised. Any
other ordering silently changes every number.

Runs under the bench venv (needs trimesh/scipy/numpy):
