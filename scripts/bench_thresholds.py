# same way cd_pca is (best alignment over the 24-rotation PCA frame).

# Why not Chamfer. Tatarchenko, Richter, Ranftl, Li, Koltun & Brox, "What
# Do Single-View 3D Reconstruction Networks Learn?", CVPR 2019
# (DOI 10.1109/cvpr.2019.00352): under CD and IoU, retrieval and
# classification baselines are statistically indistinguishable from
# reconstruction — the metrics rank category priors, not surface
# agreement — and F-score at a threshold is the discriminative axis.
# Measured here (OT-33, 2026-09-10, disclosed rolls 1 and 2, 18 instances
# each): cd_pca ranked roll 1 better (0.0270 vs 0.0289) while F@0.05
# ranked roll 2 better (0.4060 vs 0.4454); the mean absolute rank shift
# between the two metrics across roll 1's instances was 2.78 places of 18.
# The proportion oracle moved cd_pca by only 0.0043, and the orientation
# term sat at the holdout's documented floor. So CD could not see what
# the writer changed.
#
# Registered BEFORE any roll was ranked on it (the OT-33 pre-registration
# in docs/2026-09-06-bench-panel-preregistration.md), for the next roll
# set onward; rolls 1-3 of the disclosed surface stay on cd_pca as their
# own pre-registration said, and none of them reached 20/20 anyway.
# Thresholds were fixed a priori; re-choosing the one that flatters a
# result after reading it is selection on the test set.
