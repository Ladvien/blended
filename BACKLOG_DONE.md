# blended — Backlog: done

Items move here from `BACKLOG.md` verbatim when they satisfy the closing rule
(`BACKLOG.md` § Closing rule): **Done means** test in the tree and green in both
layers (`make test`), spec rows amended in the same change, and — for OT-9
through OT-11 — the pre-registered hypothesis filled with a measured outcome.

Each entry records: the item block as written, the closing commit, the test(s)
that gate it, and the date closed. Nothing here is edited after it lands; a
regression reopens the item in `BACKLOG.md` with a pointer back to this entry.

## OT-1 Complete the ops facade

**What:** `blended.ops.__init__` MUST re-export every public op, including `legs`, `canonical_orientation`, and `add_lathe`. The barrel builder MUST import `add_lathe` from the facade.
**Why:** OT-3 generates schemas by introspecting the facade. Anything not on the facade is invisible to the agent and to the tests that check the whitelist. Closes spec §7.3 row 5.
**Amends:** OPS-1.
**Done means:** `tests/pure/test_one_path_ops.py` asserts that every public callable under `src/blended/ops/*.py` is reachable from the facade, and no builder imports an ops submodule directly.

**Closed:** 2026-09-10.
**Gating tests:** `tests/pure/test_one_path_ops.py::test_every_public_op_is_reachable_from_the_facade`, `::test_facade_exports_nothing_it_does_not_define`, `::test_builders_import_only_the_facade`, `::test_every_ops_submodule_is_in_the_manifest`.
**Spec:** OPS-1 row amended; §7.3 facade gap row removed.
**Side effect, measured:** adding `canonical_orientation` to `OP_MODULE_NAMES` put its ops into the manifest the model reads; assembled prompt fingerprint moved `a10:f13911deb826` → `a10:315c684fd7f6` (pin updated in the same commit). `PromptRevision.identity` did not move.
**Layers:** pure 432 passed / 1 skipped / 1 xfailed; Blender 308 passed / 3 skipped.
**Commit:** `7226f01`.
