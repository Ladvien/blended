"""The agent-facing capability manifest.

SWE-agent's measured result: a purpose-built agent-computer interface
beat a bare shell 18.0% vs 11.0% on the same model. This module is that
interface's documentation half — what an agent is told it can do before
it writes a line of bpy.

It is GENERATED FROM THE LIVE CODE (introspecting the real op modules,
the real MeshBudget fields, the real drift catalog) rather than
hand-written prose, so it cannot quietly drift out of sync with the
harness it describes. A stale manifest would be worse than none: it
would teach the agent APIs that no longer exist, which is precisely the
failure mode the drift catalog exists to prevent.
