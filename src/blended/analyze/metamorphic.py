"""Metamorphic relations: the gate that needs no reference.

Every other gate in this repository needs a specification that already
exists. `evaluate.acceptance` needs a brief with numbers in it;
`evaluate.visual_diff` needs a pinned golden render. Both are useless
the moment the thing being built has no spec — which is exactly the
hole `scripts/photo_to_model.py` declares: a photograph carries no
dimensions.

A metamorphic relation needs neither. It changes the INPUT in a known
way and asserts a relation between the two OUTPUTS. Double every length
and every extent must double. Refine the segment count and the triangle
count must rise while the extents stay put. Neither claim needs to know
what the object is, so both survive having no brief. Permute the boolean
union order and THE SOLID must not move — volume, surface area, extents
and topology class.

FALSIFIED, recorded here so it is not retried: the permutative relation
was first written to assert MESH identity, `semantic_digest` unchanged
and `triangle_count` unchanged. Measured on 2026-09-06 against both
multi-part builders, reversing the union order:

  barrel  816 -> 816 tris, volume 0.31573285487001135 both, BIT-IDENTICAL,
          digest 665a17f1... -> 4f927c63..., area rel 1.0e-9
  pallet  334 -> 336 tris, volume rel 1.7e-8, area rel 8.5e-9,
          digest 7213b524... -> 0284e97f...

So union order changes the TRIANGULATION and the vertex order — which is
all a digest sees — while leaving the solid alone to within float noise.
Blender's EXACT boolean retriangulates from whatever intermediate it was
handed, and it is entitled to: union is commutative on solids, not on
tessellations. `measure_build` therefore carries `volume_m3` and
`surface_area_m2`, and the `semantic_digest` key added for the killed
assertion was removed with it rather than left to invite the same
vacuous relation again.

THE ONE AUTHORING RULE, learned the expensive way: a relation must be
anchored in the SEMANTICS of what is being built, never in the
implementation's own arithmetic. A relation whose invariant set is read
off the artefact under test is VACUOUS. scp measured it: a
"these vertices must not move" relation defined its must-not-move set
as "the vertices with zero weight on this bone" — read from the same
weights the relation was testing — and deliberately bleeding weight
onto 200 vertices produced ZERO violations. The set moved with the
defect. Anchor the invariant outside the artefact: in the parameters,
in the constant, in the arithmetic a human can do on paper.

Which is why `Relation.justification` is a required field. A relation
nobody can justify is a relation nobody can falsify, and `probe`
refuses to run one.

MAIN THREAD ONLY: `measure_build` and `probe` touch bpy.
