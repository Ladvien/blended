"""Pairwise checks between two parts of an assembly: interpenetration
and surface separation.

The assembly briefs relate parts by position (StackedOnSpec,
SharedCentreSpec); nothing measures whether one part intersects
another. scp built the equivalent check against mesh VERTICES first and
it lied: palm-to-weapon distance read 60 mm against vertices and 6.5 mm
against the mesh SURFACE, because on box geometry the nearest vertex is
a far corner. So separation is measured on the surface, never on
vertices.

Interpenetration is a DEPTH, not a face count. Two parts that rest on
each other (a lid on its crate's rim) legitimately share coplanar
faces and even interpenetrate by the resting tolerance (the golden
crate's lid sits ~1 mm into the rim and was human-signed-off). The
face-pair crossing tests fail to distinguish: on axis-aligned boxes
every penetrating face pair touches the other solid along a
zero-depth line. So the measurement is the object-level penetration —
the minimum translation depth between the two evaluated meshes' world
AABBs — and a pair count is reported only when that depth exceeds the
contact tolerance. The count itself is the BVH AABB-overlap pair list,
the same broad phase `_count_self_intersecting_pairs` uses.

MAIN THREAD ONLY: everything below touches bpy/mathutils.

    object-level penetration depth exceeds
    ``CONTACT_DEPTH_TOLERANCE_M``. Resting contact (a lidar on its
    crate, sink within 2 mm) reads zero.

    ``minimum_separation_m``: each object's evaluated vertices in world
    space (all of them when under ``PAIR_SEPARATION_SAMPLE_LIMIT``,
    else every ``ceil(count / limit)``-th) measured to the other
    object's closest SURFACE point, minimised over both directions.
    Surface, never nearest-vertex. An UPPER BOUND on the true
    surface-to-surface separation, not the separation itself: the
    closest approach between two coarse solids is edge-to-edge and
    touches no vertex, and above the sample limit most vertices are
    never probed. Measured: two crossing 1 mm plates that share volume
    — true separation 0 — report 0.999 m in both argument orders.
    Direction matters, because `evaluate.acceptance` fails a relation
    on ``minimum_separation_m < required``, so an over-estimate makes
    that gate lenient and never strict.

    Both directions on purpose: sampling one side only made
    ``analyze_pair(a, b)`` and ``analyze_pair(b, a)`` disagree whenever
    the meshes differed in vertex density (measured 0.0224 m one way,
    0.3274 m the other), and a separation measure that depends on
    argument order is not a measure. The MINIMUM of the two one-sided
    readings, not the maximum: each is an over-estimate of the same
    infimum, so the smaller is the better estimate. That is the
    opposite convention to the two-sided Hausdorff distance
    (``max`` of the one-sided distances), which measures shape
    dissimilarity rather than closest approach.

    ``aabb_penetration_depth_m``: the world-AABB minimum translation
    depth, the same number that gates the pair count. It is the
    residual limit made visible — a genuine interpenetration whose
    AABB min-axis overlap stays under ``CONTACT_DEPTH_TOLERANCE_M``
    (parts thinner than 2 mm, or a grazing crossing) is reported by
    neither ``intersecting_face_pair_count`` nor a shrunken
    ``minimum_separation_m``. Gated by
    ``NoInterpenetrationSpec.maximum_aabb_penetration_depth_m``, which
    the crate-with-lid brief sets: opt-in, because AABB depth is
    meaningless for parts that legitimately share a bounding volume.
    An AABB depth is a PROXY for penetration depth; the principled
    measure is a signed distance field, which would also give the sign
    this pair of numbers lacks — `10.1109/tvcg.2006.56` (Jones,
    Bærentzen & Šrámek, 3D distance fields: a survey of techniques and
    applications) surveys the construction if that trade is ever worth
    making.
