"""The mesh analyzer: the hard acceptance gate.

The agentic-3D literature is unanimous that once a script executes, the
remaining failures are structural (disconnected components, bad
geometry) and are NOT fixed by more agent autonomy (3DCodeBench) and
NOT reliably caught by VLM screenshot critique (TikZ study: verifiers
are biased toward accepting). So the gate is this analyzer, and the
render critique is advisory.

Check list follows the Attene/Campen/Kobbelt repair taxonomy for
*designed* meshes: non-manifoldness, gaps (boundary edges),
degeneracies, disconnected components (Polygon Mesh Repairing,
DOI 10.1145/2431211.2431214). Validity checks are kept apart from
quality judgements per Fukaya et al.'s metric framework
(DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2024.3398998).
