"""The harness entry point: the whole loop in one call.

    execute (retry <= 2, logged) -> analyzer gate -> contact sheet
        -> (optional) verified glTF export

Two front doors, one spine:

* run_chunk(source, ...)  — the AGENT path: source code in, structured
  result out. The fix_source callback is where the agent rewrites code
  from the drift-annotated retry prompt.
* run_builder(builder, ...) — the LIBRARY path: a Parameters+Builder
  object in, same gates, same result.

Design commitments enforced here rather than re-argued per call site:
the analyzer is the hard gate; the contact sheet is produced on FAIL
as well as PASS (a failure you cannot review is a failure you will
repeat); export only runs on gate-passing meshes and is itself
verified by welded round trip.
