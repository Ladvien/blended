"""The retry loop: execution feedback with drift fixes attached.

3DCodeBench's central result: a stateless retry loop that feeds the
previous script and its traceback back to the generator, capped at TWO
retries, lifted executability 0.702 -> 0.974 (+27.2 pp). Most fixes are
localized API corrections that are "well within model competence once
the traceback is visible." This module is that loop.

The harness does not call a model. The `fix_source` callback is the
seam: in production it is the agent rewriting the source given
`build_retry_prompt(...)`; in tests it is a deterministic function.
