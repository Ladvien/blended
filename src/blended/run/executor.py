"""Script execution with structured traceback capture.

The execution-feedback loop is the single biggest measured lever in
agentic 3D modeling (3DCodeBench: visible tracebacks + <=2 retries took
executability 0.702 -> 0.974). This module's job is to make the
environment tell the truth loudly: every run returns a RunResult with
the full traceback, and failed runs are matched against the drift
catalog so known API moves are surfaced with their fix attached.

Execution is in-process, against the current bpy: a bpy wheel, or code
already inside Blender.
