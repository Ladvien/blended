"""Transform operations through the data API (no bpy.ops, no context).

Every op here reads `matrix_world`, which Blender evaluates LAZILY:
setting `.location` or `.rotation_euler` does NOT update it until the
dependency graph runs. Reading it before then returns the STALE matrix
(identity on a fresh object) and the transform silently does nothing —
no error, no warning. Measured: an agent set rotation and location,
called apply_object_transform, and its vertices were untouched, so
three splayed stool legs collapsed into a single central post.

So every function here refreshes the depsgraph first. See the drift
catalog.
