"""Name-to-datablock resolution shared by every op.

OPS-21 (OT-2): an op's signature carries no bpy type. Callers — the agent
through a generated tool schema, a builder, a test — hand over the NAME
of an object, and the op looks it up here. One helper, one error, so a
typo in a name fails the same way from every op instead of surfacing as
whichever AttributeError the first bpy access happens to raise.

Private (underscore module): not part of the facade, not in the
manifest, not a tool. The facade's contract test skips underscore
modules for exactly this reason.
