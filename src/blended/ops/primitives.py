"""Primitive construction operations.

Convention: build with bmesh / the data API, not bpy.ops primitives.
Operators depend on context (active object, mode, area) and their
keyword arguments drift across versions; bmesh construction is
context-free, deterministic, and headless-safe. This is the base
vocabulary the reusable-component library grows from — executable code
as the action space (CodeAct, DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2402.01030) over a
surface that survives Blender's API drift (BlenderLLM,
DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2412.14203).

Convention: construction is IDEMPOTENT BY NAME. A failed attempt leaves
its partial objects in the scene; re-creating under the same name would
silently become "Name.001" while lookups still find the stale "Name"
(measured in the stage-1 retry test — see drift catalog). So every
constructor first removes any existing object with its target name.
