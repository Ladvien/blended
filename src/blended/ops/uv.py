"""UV unwrapping — with the op verifying its own output.

Unwrapping is the one place bpy.ops is unavoidable: the solvers have no
data-API equivalent. So this module owns the context handling (mode
switching, selection, restore) and keeps it out of every builder — the
agent-computer-interface argument: one purpose-built op instead of
context wrangling at each call site.

METHOD CHOICE IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Overlap counts from our own
analyzer, same three meshes:

    method          plain box      crate          barrel (lathe)
    ANGLE_BASED     0 overlaps     0 overlaps     0 overlaps
    SMART_PROJECT   0 overlaps     0 overlaps     210 overlaps
    CUBE_PROJECT    48 overlaps    360 overlaps   20,624 overlaps

ANGLE_BASED is therefore the default: it is the only method that stayed
clean on curved lathe geometry. It pays for that with island count
(barrel: 344 islands vs smart_project's 26), so SMART_PROJECT remains
available for boxy props where it is both clean and tidier. CUBE_PROJECT
stacks by design and is offered only for deliberate tiling work.

Every unwrap returns an UnwrapReport including its own overlap count, so
a bad atlas is visible at the call site rather than three stages later.
