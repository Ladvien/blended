"""Post-CSG healing: weld and de-degenerate a mesh in place.

The EXACT boolean solver is reliable about topology but litters the
seam with exact-duplicate vertices and occasional zero-area slivers
(measured on the pallet: 7 duplicate pairs + 1 zero-area face from
three embed-seam unions). Every boolean op heals its own output so
builders never ship solver debris — and the analyzer stays a defect
detector instead of a solver-debris counter.
