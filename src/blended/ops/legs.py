"""Splayed legs that stand flat where they were asked to stand.

A splayed leg is a tilted cylinder, and a tilted cylinder's end cap is
a tilted ellipse. Stand its base centre on the foot circle, then cut
the result flush with the floor, and the cap crosses z=0 — high on the
outer side, low on the inner — so the cut keeps a crescent whose
centroid sits INBOARD of where the leg was placed. Measured, twice, at
exactly r=0.1281 m against a specified 0.1400 +/- 0.0100.

Twice is why this module exists. The first was this suite's own
reference stool. The second was the agent at iteration 17, which placed
all three bases on the foot circle, cut them flat, and reported success
because it verified the axis it had positioned rather than the sole
that resulted — "each foot's axis landing on radius 0.14". A trap that
catches the harness's author and the agent it supervises is not a
lapse of care, and prose telling the reader to remember trigonometry
would leave it to be re-derived on every run.

So the arithmetic lives here instead:

  drop        = leg_radius / cos(splay) + margin   whole cap clears z=0
  base_radius = foot_radius + drop * tan(splay)    axis crosses z=0 ON
                                                   the foot circle
  length      = hypot(rise, run) + drop            regains what the
                                                   drop spent

`add_splayed_leg` applies all three together. There is no argument
combination that reproduces the trap, which is the point: the failure
mode is now unreachable rather than discouraged.

`trim_soles_flat` is the other half. A leg placed by this module still
ends below the floor by design, and the cut is what turns its tilted
cap into a face to stand on. Cut BEFORE snapping to the ground, never
after: snapping lifts the object until its lowest POINT is at z=0,
which leaves nothing below the plane for the cutter to remove.
