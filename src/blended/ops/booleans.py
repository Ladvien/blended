"""CSG operations via the boolean modifier, applied through the depsgraph.

The EXACT solver is the reliability default; it is slower than FAST but
does not leave the near-coplanar garbage FAST does. Every operation
consumes its operand (the cutter/addend is removed afterward) so scenes
never accumulate hidden helper objects — an invisible leftover cutter is
exactly the kind of state that made retries lie (see drift catalog).

Every CSG result must go back through the analyzer: booleans are the
single most common way a designed mesh silently goes non-manifold.
