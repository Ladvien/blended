"""Normalize a user's photograph into something the wire can carry.

The harness's own renders are already PNGs of a known size, so nothing
here existed before: `compose.py` loads only images this package wrote.
A phone photo is different — multi-megapixel, usually JPEG, sometimes
HEIC — and both model transports hardcode PNG: `claude_code._image_block`
stamps `media_type: "image/png"` and the OpenAI lane emits a
`data:image/png;base64,...` URL. So a reference photo is re-encoded to
PNG and capped on its long edge before it ever reaches a model.

Blender bundles no EXIF reader and neither does the dev venv, so the
orientation tag is ignored: a sideways phone photo stays sideways and
the model will read a sideways object. There is no rotation handling.
