"""The bridge from a live session to 3DCodeBench's standalone script (OT-20).

3DCodeBench (DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2606.01057) scores a STANDALONE script:
it re-executes `<inst>/<inst>.py` from an empty scene in a bare Blender
and measures the mesh that comes out. The harness does not write
scripts — it drives a live `bpy` session through tool calls. The bridge
is that the calls ARE the script: every `run_python` chunk whose Python
ran, and every op-tool call that ran, emitted in order, is the program
the benchmark re-bakes.

Which calls count is a correctness question, and the answer is not "did
it succeed" but "what did the live scene end up holding". A call whose
Python ran and only the analyzer gate objected (`locate`, `gate`,
`export`) is INCLUDED, because that gate is this harness's standard, not
3DCodeBench's, and the geometry exists either way. Measured 2026-09-10:
the bridge that read only `run_python` chunks dropped 34 op calls on
Bottle and 37 on Pillar from what the bench re-baked.

A call that RAISED is included too when it changed the scene before it
raised (OT-31). Measured 2026-09-10 on OT-27's cloud roll 1: Spoon's
first chunk built the handle and then died on
`TypeError: create_uvsphere: keyword "diameter" is invalid`; the very
next `list_scene` reported `Spoon: 956 tris`, and every later call in
the recorded conversation was written against that object. Dropping the
chunk made the bake die with `UnknownObject: no object named 'Spoon'` —
the replay could not reproduce the run it was replaying. Such a call is
emitted inside a `try` that reports the same failure, because the chunk
is deterministic: re-running it in a fresh scene stops at the same
point, leaving the same partial geometry. A call that raised and changed
NOTHING stays out; including it would only guarantee a re-bake failure.

`changed_scene` is ground truth from `bpy.data`, taken by the recorder
either side of the dispatch, never inferred from the outcome — a gate
that shares a derivation with the thing it gates cannot fail.

An op call is emitted as `_op(name, {validated arguments})`, bound at
bake time through the same `bind_arguments` the loop used, so a
dataclass argument (`tuple[BoneSpec, ...]`, an `EdgeSelector`) is
rebuilt by one converter rather than rendered as Python source by a
second one. The re-bake therefore needs `blended` importable — the
disclosed deviation from the benchmark's pure-bpy convention that the
`sys.path` prelude already carries.

Pure: strings in, a string out.
