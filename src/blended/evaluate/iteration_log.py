One JSON object per iteration, never rewritten. The log is the evidence

the prompt identity that ran, what the deterministic gates measured,

classification, and the hypothesis behind the next edit.

Append-only matters. A convergence claim is "three consecutive clean

# The four causes an iteration failure can have. Exactly one applies,

# the loop from "fixing" a code bug by rewording the prompt until the
# bug is hidden.
#
# HARNESS_CRITIQUE is the fourth because the critique is itself a
# fallible instrument, and its failures look exactly like the other
# three from the outside. LL3M measured a critic VLM that missed
# spatial errors a human caught in 3-4 follow-ups; the TikZ study
# measured visual verification at imperfect precision AND recall. So a
# run can fail two ways that are not about the asset at all: the
# critique answered "Yes" to a question the render answers "No" (a
# missed deviation), or it reported a deviation that is not there (a
# false positive). Either way the artifact to fix is the critique — the
# eye's question set, the render that feeds it, or the gate that should
# have measured the thing instead of asking about it. Tuning the
# working agreement to satisfy a blind critic tunes the wrong artifact
# and bakes the blindness in. This project has already paid for the
# distinction once: see the mistake memory entry
# "the-critique-explained-away-its-own-evidence", where the critique
# held both the evidence and the verdict, answered Yes, and the human
# caught the angled sole by eye at iteration 4.
