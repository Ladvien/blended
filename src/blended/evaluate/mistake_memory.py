"""The Experience Library: mistakes that must never recur.

3DCodeBench's curated Experience Library is the model — a durable
record consulted BEFORE acting, not a postmortem written after. The
drift catalog next door holds API-level lessons (a symbol moved, a call
lies). This holds LOOP-level lessons: what the harness, the prompt, or
the acceptance spec got wrong, and the assertion that now guards it.

A record is not complete until `guarded_by` names something executable.
"Be careful about X" is not a guard; a test that fails when X recurs is.

Shape per CoALA's procedural memory — reflect experience into knowledge,
then into a code library (DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2309.02427); the open
problem is stale memory dominating (memory-mechanism survey,
DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2404.13501), which is why `recorded_on` is a field.

            "serving the edit. A review on 2026-10-02 found six defects in "

            "had returned, which happens before the SDK writes the response; "
            "an exit in that gap dropped the result of a call Blender had "
            "applied (5 of 5 at a 1 ms lead), so the exit now also waits "
            "SOURCE_RESPONSE_DRAIN_S after the last return. (2) A file "
            "removed between the listing and the stat (macOS sed -i temp "
            "files: 1173 of 3663 edits) or a dangling Emacs .#name.py lock "
            "raised FileNotFoundError, killing the server and failing calls; "
            "it now counts as absent. (3) A change landing while the server "
            "waited for idle did not restart the settle clock, so the exit "
            "could land mid-rewrite. (4) The watcher also killed --transport "
            "http servers, which nothing restarts; it was made stdio-only. "
            "That default was still wrong: Claude Code does not restart a "
            "stdio server either, and the review's own session lost every "
            "blended tool 8 s after an edit. Since 2026-10-02 the watcher is "
            "off by default for every transport; omp opts in through its "
            "own blended entry in .omp/mcp.json (measured: omp spawned that "
            "entry with the flag, not the one in .mcp.json). A watcher exit "
            "now writes logs/mcp-handoff-<client pid>.json, so the client's "
            "next server keeps the declared plan and the session log; before "
            "that, a restart answered the next scene-changing call with 'No "
            "plan declared'. (5) The purge ran before the stale-copy check, so "
            "another checkout's blended was dropped silently instead of "
            "refused. (6) CPython accepts a timestamp .pyc whose source has "

            "in the second of the last compile the purge re-imported the old "
