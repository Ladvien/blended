"""Did a follow-up EDIT the asset that existed, or replace it?

Locality is a property of the EDIT, not of the asset, and no measurement
of the finished mesh can recover it. A rebuild that re-runs the same
construction from the same constants lands on the same numbers, so
`RefinementOutcome.preservation_failures` — which compares what was
measured before against what is measured after — has nothing to report.
Iteration 14 is the proof: the taller_stool follow-up re-ran
add_cylinder / boolean_union / ground-cut at 0.55 m instead of editing
the stool in front of it, and the refinement gate said "0 disturbed",
correctly, because nothing was.

So identity is STAMPED rather than inferred. The primitives are
idempotent by name (`add_cylinder` calls `remove_object_and_mesh(name)`
first), which means rebuilding under the same name destroys the
datablock and takes any custom property with it. An in-place edit — a
transform, a boolean against the existing object, a bevel — carries the
stamp through untouched. That asymmetry is the whole measurement.

EVIDENCE, NOT A GATE. Ruled 2026-08-22: a rebuild that preserves every
measurement the user did not name is an acceptable way to satisfy a
follow-up, so nothing here fails a run and `IterationRecord.passed`
never consults it. What it buys is a history that can answer "did the
agent edit or rebuild" long after the render is forgotten — the
question LL3M cares about, since a rebuild costs minutes where an edit
costs seconds, and the log is the only place that cost is visible.
