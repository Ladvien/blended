"""Rebuild a scored iteration from its own recorded calls.

The iteration log stores every tool call in full — each run_python
source and, since OT-8, each op call with its arguments — so a scored
run is reproducible without a model, a network, or a lucky generation.
Verified 2026-08-22: replaying iterations 10 and 11 reproduced their
acceptance reports number for number.

This is what a golden snapshot is checked against. Re-importing the
exported .glb would NOT do: `ingest.import_glb` normalizes what it
reads — it recentres on the vertex centroid and re-grounds — which is
right for an arbitrary generated asset and wrong for evidence, because
it moves the very placement the snapshot exists to pin.

MAIN THREAD ONLY: executes chunks against the live scene.
