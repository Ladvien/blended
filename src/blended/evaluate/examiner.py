"""A structured, reference-guided visual examiner for rendered assets.

The human verdict is replaced, for loop purposes, by an instrument with
a closed answer space and a measured license to speak. The design rests
on three corpus findings, cited in the code below:

- Reference guidance lifts recall on defect spotting (RESP,
  10.48550/arXiv.2604.11082), and an *irrelevant* reference is worse
  than none — so the reference is pinned per brief and its integrity is
  verified before every use (`GoldenReferenceMismatch`).
- VLM critics are position-biased (BlenderGym, 10.48550/arXiv.2504.01786)
  and judge order matters (MT-bench, 10.48550/arXiv.2306.05685): every
  view is examined twice, reference-first and test-first, and only tags
  consistent across both orders count.
- Strict aggregation wins: permissive OR over single calls is dominated
  by false alarms (RESP aggregation; TikZ, 10.48550/arXiv.2606.15693),
  so the deviation set is the order-consistent intersection, and the
  instrument is trusted only after calibration licenses it
  (`Calibration.problems`).

This module imports no `bpy` — it reads PNGs and calls the eye through
the `describe(image_paths, prompt=...)` seam, so the whole instrument is
testable in the pure layer with a stub eye.

#
# Measured 2026-09-06, and this split exists because of it: cross-run
# control specificity was 0.50, and BOTH false alarms were TRUE
# observations of variation the brief leaves free — planter_box's
# exemplar is base colour (0.45, 0.28, 0.15) and the flagged clean
# candidate is (0.35, 0.22, 0.12), identical dimensions; the stool
# pair shares a bbox and differs inside it. Asking "does this match
# the exemplar?" manufactures a deviation for every property the brief
# leaves unspecified, so the question is restricted to what only
# vision can adjudicate.
#
# The coverage cost was measured before the tags moved, not assumed
# (outputs/gate_covers_fixture.py): the zoo's `fat_seat` fixture (seat
# scaled 1.5x) fails the FORM gate at seat_diameter_x 0.6000 against
# 0.4000 +/- 0.0200, so `wrong_proportion` is fully covered by a
# measurement. `material_missing` is covered by the material gate's
# assignment check plus `DistinctMaterialSpec`'s colour-contrast probe.
# Tool feedback outranks model feedback (10.48550/arXiv.2409.02977),
