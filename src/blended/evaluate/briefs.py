"""Test briefs: a prompt, and what the result must MEASURE.

A convergence loop needs its acceptance criteria to be executable, not
adjudicated. CADCodeVerify's contribution is exactly this — it recovers
correctness by asking measurable questions of the geometry rather than
asking a VLM whether the picture looks right — and the TikZ visual-
verification study is the reason not to invert that order: verifiers
looking at renders are systematically biased toward accepting.

So every brief carries three kinds of assertion, all measured:

* DIMENSIONS — bounding-box extents per axis, against a named tolerance.
* SOLIDITY PROBES — is there material at this point, or not? This is the
  one that earns its place. "The planter's drainage hole is sealed shut"
  is the canonical wrong-object failure the analyzer cannot see and a
  render will not show: a sealed hole and an open one are the same
  picture from outside. A parity ray cast at the hole's centre answers
  it in a number.
* GROUNDING — the base sits on z=0, within tolerance.
* GROUND CONTACT — each foot presents a flat sole ON z=0, measured as
  an area. Grounding is one number and a single touching point
  satisfies it; standing up requires a face.

A brief names PARTS, not one object. Most briefs are single-part — the
object the agent builds — but an assembly (a crate with a lid) has two
objects, each with its own acceptance spec, plus RELATIONS that pin
how the parts sit against each other. `object_name` does not exist;
the parts are the objects.

Config is separate from construction (project rule): every quantity
below is a named constant with its unit in the name, and briefs compose
those constants. No literal appears inside an assertion.
