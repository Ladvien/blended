"""A semantic digest of built geometry: same build, same hash.

Two builds of the same parameters must produce the same asset. Proving
that needs a comparison that is neither too tight nor too loose, and
both failure modes were measured in scp:

* `.blend` BYTES carry a Blender version stamp and a file-write
  timestamp, so a byte hash reports drift on a build that did not
  change.
* RAW FLOATS carry last-bit noise from the order the arithmetic
  happened in, so a float hash cries wolf for the same reason.

So this hashes QUANTIZED SEMANTIC TUPLES: the numbers a consumer of the
asset can perceive, rounded onto a grid an order of magnitude finer
than any gate tolerance in this repository. The comparison itself is
then exact string equality — a digest with a numeric tolerance is not a
digest, it is a second, undocumented gate.

Components are hashed SEPARATELY so a mismatch names the drifted
datablock. "The build is not reproducible" starts an investigation;
"mesh:Barrel drifted, transform:Barrel did not" ends one.

MAIN THREAD ONLY: everything below touches bpy.
