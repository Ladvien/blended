"""The task entry point: intent in, verified asset out.

This is the layer that was missing while `blended` was only a
well-instrumented modeling library. It closes the loop the research
describes: a task specification goes in, an agent writes code, the code
executes, the GATE judges it, and any failure is fed back to the agent
in a form written FOR the agent rather than for a human reading chat.

The `write_code` callback is the model boundary. The harness never
imports an LLM client; whoever calls this supplies one. That keeps the
gates testable with deterministic stand-ins and keeps model choice out
of the harness.

Iteration is capped at 3 rounds (measured: quality converges or
degrades past ~3 — Planner-Actor-Critic 2026), after which the task
escalates to a human with the contact sheet attached.
