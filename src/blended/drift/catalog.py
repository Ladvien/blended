"""API drift catalog: known Blender API changes and their fixes.

This file is a first-class artifact, not a comment. Every time a
traceback teaches us that an API moved, the lesson lands here in the
same commit as the fix, so the agent (and the humans) stop paying for
it twice. 3DCodeBench's curation pipeline kept exactly this artifact
("Blender 5.0 API module" of their Experience Library) and found API
drift to be the dominant failure family.

Entry sources are tagged: [measured] = hit in one of our own sessions;
[3DCodeBench] = reported error fingerprint from arXiv:2606.01057.
