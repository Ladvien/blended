"""GLB ingestion: the entry point of the neural/generated lane.

A generated GLB arrives as an arbitrary object tree (mesh parts,
empties, sometimes armatures) with arbitrary transforms. Ingestion
flattens that into ONE mesh object under OUR conventions: world
transforms baked in, base at z=0, centered on X/Y, deterministic name,
identity matrix. Materials are not preserved at this stage — the
geometry lane runs first; texture handling is its own stage.

Everything downstream (analyzer, cleanup, capture) then treats a
generated mesh exactly like a built one. One set of gates, two lanes.
