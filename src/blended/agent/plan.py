"""The turn plan: a numbered list of natural-language steps the agent
declares before it touches the scene, shown to the user with a progress
bar that advances as the steps run.

This is the substrate for Decision D1 of the chat-UX overhaul. The
design follows Magentic-UI (DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2507.22358): the plan is
a sequence of short, user-readable steps shared between user and agent,
with a progress bar over the steps during execution. The plan is a
shared representation, NOT an approval gate — users approve ≈93 % of
permission prompts (DOI 10.48550/arxiv.2604.14228), so gating every
turn would rubber-stamp and add latency. The agent declares, the UI
shows, the user can interrupt; nothing waits for a click.

Why a plan is worth a tool call at all: a planner/actor/critic split
with the human standing over it as supervisor measurably improves
geometric accuracy, aesthetic quality and task completion on Blender
modelling tasks over a single-prompt agent (DOI
10.48550/arxiv.2601.05016). The plan surface is the part of that split
the user can actually supervise.

The module is pure Python — no bpy — so it tests in the venv without
Blender. The loop wires it into the tool dispatch and event channel.
