"""The conversational agent loop, over an Ollama- or OpenAI-compatible
endpoint.

Zero third-party dependencies — Blender's bundled Python has no pip
packages, and an addon that needs `pip install` inside Blender is an
addon nobody runs. Everything here uses `urllib` from the stdlib.

Model choice is CONFIGURATION, not code. `ModelConfig` carries the
model name and the endpoint, and the same loop runs against a local
Ollama, Ollama Cloud, llama-swap on bmb (OpenAI protocol), or anything
speaking the Ollama or OpenAI chat APIs. See `RECOMMENDED_MODELS` for
the reasoning behind the defaults.
