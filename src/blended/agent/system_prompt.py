"""Renders the conversational agent's system prompt.

Distinct from `manifest.build_manifest()`, which is a one-shot brief for
"write this script". This is for a modeling PARTNER the user chats with
inside Blender across many turns: it establishes the working
relationship, the tool discipline, and — most importantly — what
counts as done.

The core instruction is the one the whole harness exists to enforce:
running without an error is not success, and a render that looks right
is not success. The analyzer gate decides.

This module is the ASSEMBLER. It gathers what only code can know — the
version pin, the conventions, the live ops manifest and its drift traps
— and hands them to `prompts/system_prompt.md.j2`. The prose lives in
`prompts/`; the tunable working agreement is an addressable revision in
`prompt_versions.py`, so a convergence run can cite exactly which text
it scored and roll back to its predecessor.

The user never writes any of this: non-experts design prompts
opportunistically and the result is brittle (Why Johnny Can't Prompt,
DOI 10.1145/3544548.3581388), so the chat takes plain words and the
harness supplies the agreement.

    keeps meaning what it meant. Skills are opt-in per turn until a run

    self-authored skills measured there. Unknown lanes raise.
