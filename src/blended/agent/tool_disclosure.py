"""Which op tools a call offers (OT-25).

The five briefs that pass with the hatch withheld used 4–8 distinct ops
each, 15 of 48 in all, and every call carried all 48 schemas — 7,904
tokens on bmb's tokenizer (OT-23). A call now offers the service tools,
every reader, and a CORE set of scene-changing ops; the rest are found
through `search_ops`, which returns their schemas, and dispatched by
name like any op (the door accepts every facade op).

The core set is DERIVED, never listed by hand: an op belongs to it when
it was called successfully in at least `MINIMUM_BRIEFS_USING_OP`
distinct gate-passing briefs in the iteration log. The derivation is
pinned (`_evaluate/golden/pinned_core_tools.txt`) by `scripts/
derive_core_tools.py`, and a pure test asserts the pin equals the
derivation, so the offered set cannot drift from the evidence.

The offered set is fingerprinted per turn with the same digest the
whole tool set uses, and the fingerprint rides on every tool event, so
a change in what the model was shown is visible in the record.

Pure: records in, names out.
