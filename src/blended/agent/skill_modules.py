"""Capability modules — the SKILLS half of the prompt, and its selector.

`prompt_versions.py` owns the working agreement: how the agent and the
user work together, tuned as one monolith by the convergence loop. This
module owns something different — the procedural knowledge a particular
LANE needs, which is useless weight on every turn that is not in that
lane.

The split exists because loading everything is measurably worse than
loading a little. SkillsBench (84 tasks, 11 domains, 7,308 trajectories,
`10.48550/arXiv.2602.12670`) measured curated skills at +16.2 pp overall,
but the effect depends on how many load at once:

    2-3 focused modules   +18.6 pp
    4+ modules             +5.9 pp
    written "comprehensive" -2.9 pp
    written compact        +18.8 pp

The same shape shows up in SWE-agent's window ablations — a 100-line
file view scored 18.0% where the whole file scored 12.7%
(`10.48550/arXiv.2405.15793`) — and in "lost in the middle", where 20-30
retrieved documents drove accuracy BELOW the closed-book baseline
(`10.48550/arxiv.2307.03172`). More context is not more capability.

So `MAXIMUM_MODULES_LOADED = 3` is enforced by assertion, the way
`MAXIMUM_CHANGED_HUNKS_PER_REVISION = 1` already is. A fourth module in
a lane is a design error that should surface as a red test, not as a
quietly worse agent.

TWO HONEST CAVEATS, both measured in the same study:

1. 16 of the 84 tasks got WORSE with skills, worst case -39.3 pp. A
   module is a change with a sign. Each carries `hypothesis` stated
   before its convergence run and `outcome` filled from measurement, and
   a module that measures negative is REMOVED, not tuned.
2. Self-generated skills measured -1.3 pp against +16.2 pp for curated
   ones: "models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they
   benefit from consuming." These bodies were drafted by an agent. Until
   a human has reviewed each one and a convergence run has scored it,
   the +16.2 pp result does not apply to them.

Which is why no lane is selected by default. `build_system_prompt()`
with no arguments still renders exactly the pinned, converged text and
nothing else — see `system_prompt.py`. Skills are opt-in per turn until
they are measured, because the alternative is silently changing the
prompt that every previous score was attributed to.

The bodies live in `prompts/skills/*.md.j2` for the same reason the
working agreement does: prose belongs in a file a person can read and
diff. This module is the registry.
