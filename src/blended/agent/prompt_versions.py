"""The system prompt as a VERSIONED artifact.

The prompt is the tunable part of this harness, so it is not a string
literal buried in a renderer — it is an addressable revision with an
identity the iteration log can cite and a predecessor it can be rolled
back to.

LL3M's finding is the reason each revision differs from its predecessor
by exactly ONE element: surgical edits to a working prompt outperform
rewrites, and a rewrite destroys the attribution that makes the next
edit informed. So `PROMPT_REVISIONS` reads as a diff history, and every
entry after v1 carries the hypothesis that motivated it and the outcome
that was measured — the record 3DCodeBench's Experience Library keeps,
in the artifact it is about. The Prompt Report's field note that prompts
are sensitive to detail without obvious reason (DOI
10.48550/arXiv.2406.06608) is why a pin needs repeated clean runs, not one.

This module is the REGISTRY, not the text. Each body lives in
`prompts/working_agreement_v{n}.md.j2` so it can be read and reviewed as
prose; what a file cannot carry — why the revision exists and what it
measured — lives here. `validate_revisions()` checks the two agree, and
enforces by measurement the discipline the old chained-`.replace()`
build enforced by construction.

Adding a revision: see `prompts/README.md`. In short — copy the previous
template, change ONE element, state `hypothesis` BEFORE running it, fill
`outcome` from the measurement rather than impression, and move
ACTIVE_PROMPT_REVISION only once the measurement supports it.

# --- CONVERGED --------------------------------------------------------
# v10 is PINNED, superseding the v9 pin of earlier the same day. The
# rule for THIS attempt (recorded in
# docs/2026-08-22-prompt-convergence-plan.md Phase 3): one clean
# human-verified run per brief, CONSECUTIVE, with no prompt change
# between them — five runs. Met 2026-08-22:
#
#   iteration 47  three_leg_stool    23 calls  both gates PASS  0 deviations
#   iteration 48  planter_box        15 calls  both gates PASS  0 deviations
#   iteration 49  uv_crate           22 calls  both gates PASS  0 deviations
#   iteration 50  ribbed_column       6 calls  both gates PASS  0 deviations
#   iteration 51  crate_with_lid     14 calls  both gates PASS  0 deviations
#
# All five terminated with a written report, all five exported
# round-trip-verified .glb files, and the human confirmed every render.
# The stool run also passed all THREE refinement steps (taller, wider
# seat, thicker legs) with 0 unnamed measurements disturbed — the
# multi-step refinement gate v9 was never asked to run.
#
# WHAT v10 CHANGED. One sentence added to the "gate measures STRUCTURE,
# not intent" paragraph: every feature the brief NAMES must exist as
# real geometry, not be approximated or skipped. Made because
# iteration 31 (ribbed_column) built a plain 0.20 m cylinder with NO
# ribs — the brief named a 0.16 m shaft with five ribs reaching
# 0.20 m, and the agent read the diameter as the shaft and skipped the
# rib geometry entirely. The sentence is the one element between v9
# and v10; the rest of the text is byte-identical.
#
# WHAT THE RUNS COST. The five-brief suite found three harness defects
# and two under-determined briefs before it converged: a refinement
# scorer that graded each step against the ORIGINAL brief instead of
# the accumulated one (iteration 23), a boolean that silently no-opped
# (iteration 33 — now guarded by BooleanNoOp, which compares geometry,
# not counts, because the EXACT solver cuts a tilted cap flat while
# preserving counts), and assign_material destroying a shared material
# datablock (iteration 46 — now reuses the datablock). ribbed_column
# needed its shaft diameter, rib centers, and rib thickness pinned
# (iterations 27/37/41). Each was classified into exactly one bucket
# and fixed in the right artifact; the prompt changed only once.
#
# The v9 pin was earned on its own harness and is not disowned: it is
# in the append-only log, and v9 still carries its outcome above. Its
# three runs (20/21/22) were against the two-brief suite, which is why
# v10 re-ran the sequence on the five-brief suite.
#
# The evidence is MODEL-SPECIFIC and the log records it per run.
# v1-v4 were scored against deepseek-v4-flash, which never converged
# this suite; v9 and v10 were scored against deepseek-v4-pro, which
# holds the pin.

# fails the JSON contract. kimi-k2.7-code replaced it that day on
# calibration evidence alone (sensitivity 0.80, control specificity
# 1.00) — the eye slot is earned by CALIBRATION, not by re-running the
# convergence suite, because the eye does not write the runs.
#
# claude-code:sonnet takes the slot on 2026-09-05 by the same standard,

# specificity 1.00 (5/5), problems() empty, identity
# claude-code:sonnet+examiner:60a9920cb938. Its miss is COMPLEMENTARY

# Both calibrations are kept: _evaluate/eye_calibration.json is the
# licensed one (identity-bound, so it must match the eye in use) and

# this eye is the default: it is the WRITER's own model, so a render
# reaches the writer as a native image block instead of a prose
# summary, and RESP measures the reference-paired path at recall 0.76
# against 0.28 for no reference (10.48550/arXiv.2604.11082).
