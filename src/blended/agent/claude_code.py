"""Claude Code in headless mode, as a harness transport.

A third transport shape beside the two HTTP protocols in `loop.py`: this
lane's "server" is a local subprocess that owns its own authentication
and its own rate limits. `claude auth status` on this machine reports
`authMethod: claude.ai`, `apiProvider: firstParty` — this module execs
the binary Anthropic ships and never reads, stores or forwards a token,
which is what separates it from the third-party subscription-OAuth
pattern Anthropic prohibited for other harnesses.

Everything below rests on flags and frame shapes measured against the
live CLI (2.1.260) on 2026-09-05; `docs/2026-09-05-claude-code-lane-plan.md`
records the probes. The three that shape the design:

* `--input-format stream-json` requires `--output-format stream-json`,
  which requires `--verbose`. All three or none — and stream-json input
  is the only way to hand the model an image.
* EACH `{"type":"user"}` frame is one billed turn: two user frames in one
  invocation produced two `system init` frames and two `result` frames.
  So a stateless `chat(messages)` call folds the whole conversation into
  exactly ONE trailing user frame. `{"type":"assistant"}` frames are
  accepted as history, but they cannot help here: every interior
  user/tool block would still need a user frame of its own, and moving
  them all after the assistant turns would put tool results before the
  calls that produced them.
* `--json-schema` validates structured output, `oneOf` included, and
  hands back the parsed object as `structured_output`. Tool calls are
  therefore CONSTRAINED, not parsed out of prose — grammar-constrained
  decoding guarantees the output conforms to the schema instead of
  hoping a model formats correctly (Geng et al., Grammar-Constrained
  Decoding for Structured NLP Tasks without Finetuning, DOI
  10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.674). A chat-only turn still answers
  through the schema, with `tool_calls: []`.
