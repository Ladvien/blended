"""
blended's tool surface served through this MCP server.

Every tool in ``blended.agent.tools.TOOL_SCHEMAS`` (service tools and
facade ops) is listed beside the upstream tools and dispatched inside
Blender through ``dispatch_tool``, the one door the in-process agent
loop also uses (see ``blended_bridge_toolcode.py``). The server side
keeps what the loop keeps: the plan gate (a scene-changing tool is
refused until ``declare_plan`` succeeded) and one schema-2 ToolEvent per
call in ``logs/mcp-*.jsonl``, the record ``scripts/mine_candidate_ops.py``
mines. Renders come back as MCP image content.

The add-on execs whatever reaches its localhost socket: the exec-over-
localhost threat model of MCP is discussed in DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2503.23278.
Agentic Blender code generation: LL3M, DOI 10.48550/arXiv.2508.08228.

Freshness: every call carries ``source_fingerprint()`` so Blender purges
and re-imports ``blended`` after a source edit, and
``BlendedFastMCP.exit_on_source_change`` ends an idle server whose own
code went stale; the MCP client restarts it and re-lists the tools.

# Must-read: the rules every blended session follows

The user watches this Blender's 3D viewport while you work. This head is the
part of these instructions every client delivers; the full text follows it.

1. Call `declare_plan` before any tool that changes the scene.
2. Build with blended's op tools. `run_python` is the last resort, and its
   `reason` must name what the ops lack.
3. Work in the SMALLEST step that makes progress. Read the gate report after
   every call and fix the specific measured failure.
4. Done is three things, in order: it executed, it passed the gate, and it
   looks right in `render_views` from several angles. Executing is not
   passing; passing is not looking right.
5. The gate measures structure, not intent. After the LAST operation, measure
   every number the user gave (sizes, thicknesses, positions, counts) on the
   finished object and print what you measured.
6. Every feature the brief names (ribs, a drainage hole, three legs) is real
   geometry, verified by measuring it.
7. A part resting on a surface meets it with a flat face: measure the
   contact, not the lowest point.
8. Changing a passed asset: touch only what they named; everything else must
   measure the SAME afterwards. Re-gate and re-render after every edit.
9. When all of it holds, stop and report what you built, its measurements and
   the gate verdict. If an operation fails twice the same way, stop and say
   what you are stuck on. Art direction is the user's: ask, show renders.

Viewport: every scene-changing blended tool frames the objects it touched in
the user's 3D viewport and ends its result with a `viewport:` line. An object
is framed once it is linked into the scene. To show a different part, or one a
`run_python` chunk changed without naming it, call `{VIEWPORT_FOLLOW_TOOL_NAME}`."""
