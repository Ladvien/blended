"""Edit-versus-rebuild is measured, recorded, and never gated on.

Iteration 14 rebuilt a stool it was asked to make taller, preserved
every unnamed measurement exactly, and the human ruled that acceptable.
Two things have to stay true after that ruling, and they pull in
opposite directions: the difference must be VISIBLE — a rebuild is
minutes where an edit is seconds, and nothing in the finished mesh
records which happened — and it must not FAIL a run. A test is the only
thing that keeps both from drifting, because either one is a one-line
change away from the other.

`FakeBlenderObject` stands in for the real datablock: custom properties
are a plain mapping on the object, which is all `object_identity`
touches. Keeping this in the pure lane means the guard runs on every
`make test-pure`, not only when Blender is around.
