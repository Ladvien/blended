"""How images reach the eye: one placeholder per image, never adjacent.

Ollama's renderer prepends `[img-0][img-1]...` back to back when a
message carries images and no explicit placeholders, and llama.cpp's
mtmd tokenizer merges *consecutive* same-size bitmaps into video frames
for the qwen-vl family (ollama/ollama#17321, ggml-org/llama.cpp#24303,
both open). Every render this harness makes comes out of the same
`CaptureSettings`, so every pair is the same size — the exact case that
merges.

Measured 2026-08-22 against `qwen3-vl:8b` on ollama 0.32.14: two 512x512
renders in one message cost 1055 prompt tokens (one image's worth), the
model answered "1" to "how many images did you receive?", and the
examiner returned `cannot_tell` because it had never been shown the
render under review. With the placeholders below: 2089 tokens, both
objects named, and the naming follows the order when the pair is
swapped.

That is a silent instrument failure — a calibrated examiner that cannot
see the candidate scores every defect as unseen — so the wire shape is
pinned here rather than left to a comment. Interception is at
`_request`, the HTTP boundary, because `describe` builds its own client
to swap in the eye's model: the payload on the wire is the only honest
place to assert what the model will be shown.
