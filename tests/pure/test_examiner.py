"""Pure layer: the structured examiner, with a stub eye (no network).

The examiner is the instrument that replaces the human verdict in the
convergence loop, so its tests pin the three failure modes that would
silently corrupt the loop if they regressed:

- Defect 1's exact shape: a denial ("I don't see any missing...") must
  score as NO deviation, not as a sighting — the old scorer counted it
  as both (see mistake memory
  "the-eye-scorer-counted-a-denial-as-a-sighting").
- Order-consistency: a tag seen in only one image order is dropped
  (MT-bench position-bias mitigation, 10.48550/arXiv.2306.05685).
- The closed vocabulary: a tag outside the list, or prose instead of
  JSON, is a loud failure, never a best-effort guess.
