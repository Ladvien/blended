"""The Experience Library's contract, checked against the repository.

`validate_memory()` only asks that a guard string be non-empty, so a record
whose guard was deleted with the code it guarded kept passing: the
in-Blender chat client's removal (184095f) left 23 records pointing at test
files, modules and a GUI harness that no longer exist. These tests resolve
every reference a guard makes against the tree as it is now.
