"""Pure layer: the convergence rule, executed against the real logs.

The predecessor of `converged_suite_cycles` was never executable: it
grouped briefs by iteration NUMBER while the protocol runs one brief
per iteration, so on iterations 47-51 — the cycle that earned the v10
pin — it returned 0, and nothing in the repo ever called it to notice.
These tests read the in-repo logs, which are the evidence the pin rests
on, so the rule is measured against the history it describes.
