"""Provenance and the human-correction log, checked without Blender.

A brief's `prompt_text` carries executable specs, but nothing else in the
module answers *where each number came from* or *what a human asked to
change*. `Provenance` pins each number to the requester's own words and
the constant that holds it; `Correction` records what moved when a human
asked. `validate_briefs` is the gate that catches a renamed constant, a
stale value, or a missing citation before the brief ships.

These tests run on every `make test-pure` because a stale provenance
entry is a doc that lies — the exact failure class the repo's
pin-verified-behavior rule exists to prevent.
