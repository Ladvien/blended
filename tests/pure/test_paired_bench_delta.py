"""The bench regression test's own statistics.

`scripts/paired_bench_delta.py` is what decides whether a 3DCodeBench
candidate regressed against the roll that set the guard, and whether the
contract's target is resolvable at all. Those numbers are load-bearing —
they are the difference between "this change helped" and "this change
landed inside a coin flip" — so the arithmetic is pinned here on data
whose answers can be checked by hand.

The tool lives in `scripts/` and is deliberately stdlib-only (it runs
under the benchmark's own venv and under a bare `python3`), so it is
imported by path rather than as a `blended.*` module.
