"""A benchmark roll runs from a freeze named by its commit, or not at all.

OT-37. Measured 2026-09-11: OT-27's cloud roll 3 ran from a hand-made
worktree at `c6e4bfc` and lost 7 of 20 instances to HTTP 502 with zero
retries, because the bounded retry had landed in `179ab11` — after the
freeze — and the plan that launched the roll assumed the fix was in the
tree. `scripts/freeze_worktree.sh` names every freeze by its commit under
one parent, so a roll that runs from there carries its commit in its
path. `scripts/bench_chain.sh` refuses anything else before it touches
the bench, and writes the frozen commit as the first line of its log.

The script is zsh, run as a subprocess; nothing here needs Blender or the
bench checkout, because the refusal happens before either is reached.
