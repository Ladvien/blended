"""The bench panel's ranking rule, and its refusals.

The panel exists because three change classes were each judged on a
single roll of `cd_yawmin` and each measured flat. So the tests that
matter here are the ones that fail when the rule is quietly relaxed: the
column order, the roll-count floor, the instance-count floor, and the
lexicographic executability rule actually being APPLIED rather than
described in prose nobody executes.
