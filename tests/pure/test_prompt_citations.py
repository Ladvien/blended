"""Prompts name tool symbols by hand, so a renamed tool mis-instructs the
writer on every turn.  These tests are the assertion that the names a
prompt cites are names the tool registry actually answers to.

The check is deliberately narrow: only single-backtick identifiers that
*look like a tool call* — ``run_python``, ``inspect_domain``, etc. — are
asserted against the registry.  A draft that scanned all prose scored 50
hits and was right about 3 in the old repo, a 94% false-positive rate,
and a gate that cries wolf gets switched off inside a week.  That
sentence is the reason the pattern below matches
``^(run|inspect|render|search|list|export|declare)_[a-z_]+$`` and
nothing broader.

The precision-over-recall design — regex extraction of code-element
references from documentation, matched against the registry — follows
Tan, Wagner & Treude, "Detecting outdated code element references in
software repository documentation", EMSE 2023,
DOI 10.1007/s10664-023-10397-6, §8.3: "we rely on an improved version
of the regular expressions used for code element detection … and then
use a very strict filter (exact match) … we err on the side of caution
to not establish traceability links that we are not confident about."
