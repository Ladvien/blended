"""Reference-free relations over the three builders.

Every number in this file was measured before it was asserted (Blender
5.2.0, hash fbe6228777e7, 2026-09-06). The two that matter, because
they are the ones that would otherwise have been "obviously" wrong:

* PALLET, doubled: x and y double exactly, z overshoots by
  0.0004999935 m. That is `BOOLEAN_EMBED_M` (0.0005 m), an ABSOLUTE
  overlap the builder subtracts from its stack height so no boolean
  ever sees coplanar faces. It does not scale with the parameters, so
  the honest relation is `2 * before + BOOLEAN_EMBED_M`, not
  `2 * before`. Loosening the tolerance to 3e-3 to cover it would have
  hidden a real 0.5 mm of non-scale-invariance behind a round number.
* PALLET at 0.01x raises `ValueError: Deck boards thinner than the
  boolean embed` from `PalletParameters.validate` — 0.022 m x 0.01 is
  0.22 mm against a 0.5 mm embed. A builder refusing invalid
  parameters is correct, so the small-scale relation runs at the
  smallest factor its own validation accepts (0.05x, measured clean:
  0 non-manifold, 0 boundary, 0 self-intersecting).

Pallet triangle counts are NOT scale-invariant (334 at 1x, 344 at 0.1x,
348 at 0.05x): the EXACT boolean solver retriangulates differently when
the fixed 0.5 mm embed is relatively larger. That is why the
small-scale relation asserts topology and not triangle count.
