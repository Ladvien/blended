"""Rotation and placement must be in the whitelisted vocabulary.

Measured 2026-08-22 (iteration 3, three_leg_stool): the vocabulary had
no rotate op, so an agent building splayed legs spent three search_ops
calls and a dir() probe discovering that, then improvised. These ops
close the hole and bake in the depsgraph refresh that the stale
matrix_world trap requires.
