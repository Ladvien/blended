"""Pair separation is measured on the SURFACE, never on vertices, and
it is measured in BOTH directions.

scp's measured trap: palm-to-weapon distance read 60 mm against mesh
vertices and 6.5 mm against the mesh surface, because on box geometry
the nearest vertex is a far corner. Two wrong root causes were
announced off that artifact.

The second trap is argument order. Sampling only the first object's
vertices makes the measurement a function of which mesh is denser, so
``analyze_pair(a, b)`` and ``analyze_pair(b, a)`` disagreed. Measured
on the fixtures below: 0.0224 m one way, 0.3274 m the other, a 14.6x
spread on the same two solids.
