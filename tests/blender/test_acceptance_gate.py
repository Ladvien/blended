"""The acceptance gate must be able to FAIL.

Project rule 9: every validator ships with a seeded-defect test that
trips it. The acceptance gate is what decides whether a convergence
iteration passed, so a check here that cannot fail would silently
certify every prompt revision as converged.

Each test builds the defect deliberately, then asserts that exactly the
intended check trips — not merely that something failed.
