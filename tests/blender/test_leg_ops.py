"""The sole lands where it was asked to land — measured, not derived.

`tests/pure/test_splayed_leg_spec.py` checks the algebra. This checks
the mesh: build a leg through the op, cut it flush with the floor, and
measure the area-weighted centroid of the faces that actually touch
z=0. That centroid is what `GroundContactProbe` grades, and it is the
number that read 0.1281 against a specified 0.1400 twice — once from
this suite's own reference stool, once from the agent at iteration 17.

The naive construction is built here too, and asserted to still fail.
A guard that only proves the fixed path works would pass just as
happily if the fix were deleted.
