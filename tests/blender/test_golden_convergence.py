"""Golden snapshots of the runs that converged prompt v10.

Sign-off stores the render, the parameter snapshot and the regression
test together, and the harness detects drift against them. These are
the five runs that met the convergence rule on 2026-08-22 — human
verified, both deterministic gates clean, no prompt change between them,
one run per brief:
iteration 47 (three_leg_stool), 49 (uv_crate), 51 (crate_with_lid), and
— since 2026-09-10 — 66 (planter_box) and 67 (ribbed_column).

66 and 67 replaced 48 and 50 when OPS-21 (OT-2) made every op take and
return object NAMES. The recorded sources of 48 and 50 fetched a bpy
object and handed it to an op (`assign_material(o, ...)`,
`link_into_scene(col)`), or read `.name` off a constructor's return;
under the new contract those chunks raise, so the runs no longer
replay: planter measured 0 of 1 material slots assigned, the column was
never linked. The three survivors never dereferenced an op's return.
The replacements ran the SAME pinned v10 text (identity checked below)
on the claude-code:sonnet lane and passed both deterministic gates with
the same numbers; the pixel gate reported "the render moved" against
the 48/50 views (planter shading RMSE 0.075, column silhouette IoU
0.9948), which is what a fresh run looks like next to a replay. The
48/50 sign-off survives in the append-only iteration log.

Signed off by the user on the 66/67 contact sheets, 2026-09-10: same
geometry and form numbers as 48/50, planter a shade darker, column a
greyer material. The pin stands.

The v9 snapshots this file used to hold were replaced, not kept beside
these. v9 converged on the two-brief suite; the five-brief suite
changed the briefs (parts restructure, three new briefs, two new
refinement steps), so its numbers are not reproducible against today's
code, and a golden test that cannot run is not evidence. The v9
sign-off survives where it belongs: in the append-only iteration log,
and in `prompt_versions`, where v9 still carries its measured outcome.

Each is rebuilt by REPLAYING the run's own recorded chunks, so this
suite needs no model, no network and no lucky generation. Replay rather
than re-import: `ingest.import_glb` normalizes what it reads — it
recentres on the vertex centroid and re-grounds — which is right for an
arbitrary generated asset and wrong for evidence, because it moves the
very placement the snapshot exists to pin. The .glb files beside these
tests are for a human to turn; the numbers come from the replay.

This answers a different question from the reference-stool fixtures
next door: those ask "is the brief satisfiable", this asks "does the
thing we signed off still measure the same". A change to a probe, a
tolerance, an op or a builder that silently moves these numbers fails
here.
